"""
Application entrypoint for processing messages and executing scripts.

This module serves as the entrypoint for the application, responsible for processing incoming 
messages, determining the appropriate script to execute based on the message content, and 
executing the corresponding script.

Functions:

- process_message(message): 
    Processes the incoming message, determines the script to execute, and executes the script.
- main(): 
    Main function of the application that continuously listens for incoming messages,
    processes them, and sends back the response.
