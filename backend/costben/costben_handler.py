Module for handling cost-benefit analysis operations.

This module contains the `CostBenefitHandler` class, which manages cost-benefit analysis 
operations such as retrieving measures from Excel files, loading discount rates, calculating 
cost-benefit, and plotting results.

Classes:

- `CostBenefitHandler`: 
    Class for handling cost-benefit analysis operations.

Methods:

- `get_measure_set_from_excel`: 
    Retrieve a MeasureSet object related to a specified hazard code from an Excel file.
- `get_discount_rates_from_excel`: 
    Load discount rates from an Excel file.
- `calculate_cost_benefit`: 
    Calculate cost-benefit analysis based on current and future hazard and entity data.
- `plot_waterfall`: 
    Plot a waterfall chart for the cost-benefit analysis.
- `plot_cost_benefit`: 
    Plot the cost-benefit chart for the cost-benefit analysis.
